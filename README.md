The overall goal of this project is to:
- extract
- clean, and 
- analyse

tweets. It aims to perform a **sentiment analysis** in order to study Twitter's trends. 

The **hashtags** and **emojis** are just two new elements of Twitterâ€™s big effort to encourage more activity among its users. This is why tweets will be collected based on hashtags that user provides through a GUI. A major focus of this study is the evaluation and comparison of different **Machine Learning** algorithms for the sentiment classification. 

The classification was performed using two supervised approaches: **Naive Bayes** and **SVM**.

The dataset used for this project is based on data from the following two sources: **University of Michigan Sentiment Analysis** competition on Kaggle and **Twitter Sentiment Corpus** by Niek Sanders. It contains **1,578,627** classified tweets, where each row is marked as 1 for positive sentiment and 0 for negative sentiment.
